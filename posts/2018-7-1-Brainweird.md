There is a certain concept pressed up against the all-too-thin sheet between Meaning - that which gives us a common ground of discussion and community and understanding - and nonsense, a concept I have felt and considered for most of my life, and that is the concept of **commensurability**.

Commensurability can be taken two ways:

1. For any two given options or things, they are commensurate if one is greater, one is less, or they are both &ldquo;equal&rdquo; in some metric.

2. For any two ideas, they are commensurate if one can have comparable and common discussions about the two while not arriving at a contradiction.

Basically, commensurability is the ability to relate or compare or share common ideas or options or things. For humans, we expect, at least in some sense, that our thoughts and perceptions of the world will be commensurate with those of others, that others can interpret our experiences, our thoughts, our feelings, and derive some meaning from them. So, when they cannot, when what floats and flies and flutters through the gray matter inside your head seems to be rather foreign and strange to people around you, from the bars on the playground to the bars of WeHo; the equivalent of mental Wingdings to a world thinking in Helvetica, you might just start to hear a certain word thrown around you. A certain word that represents, on some level, a level of incommensurability, a decided departure from meaning; and that word is:

Weird.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a weird way to look at it, but&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a little&hellip; Weird.&rdquo;

_Weirdness_&nbsp;is, well, Weird because it represents something conceptually different from other generally positive words for conveying a sense of abnormality in ways worthy of admiration. &ldquo;Unique,&rdquo; &ldquo;rare,&rdquo; &ldquo;one-of-a-kind.&rdquo; They all denote the same sense of being alone, but they are distinctly complimentary. _Weird_&nbsp;reminds me a lot of the concept of &ldquo;NaN&rdquo; in programming. &ldquo;NaN&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;not a number&rdquo; and is used to represent something which is decidedly **not**&nbsp;a number, yet, if it is anything, it _is_&nbsp;a number. More than undefined, NaN is incommensurable to literally everything, even itself.

You see, even &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; can be compared to itself. undefined === undefined. It has a companionship in its absence of meaning. Undefined is one of the little puppets on the Island of Misfit Toys that go around singing upbeat jingles about their outcast status. NaN, well, you can&rsquo;t even say that it _is_&nbsp;a toy. Perhaps it can go in the toybox, be laid against and displayed amongst all the other little figurines and building blocks, but when all is said and done, when the children clean up their toys and go to bed, it will remain untouched and buried underneath the Mattel Barbies and Hasbro GI-Joes, Just a Little Weird.

This brings us to a certain concept I have rallied around to somewhat describe my experience in my nearly 20 years here on this Earth, forever having to grasp around the words I choose for people, wondering which might be the perfect Fit that gets _them_&nbsp;to Get _It_. This concept is **&ldquo;brainweird.&rdquo;**

Brainweirdness is distinct from the term &ldquo;neurodivergence&rdquo; in that it does not specifically relate to clinical mental illness diagnoses nor treatment. It is not a psychological nor psychiatric model, it is merely my way of shrugging my shoulders and saying &ldquo;sorry, can&rsquo;t relate.&rdquo; In this way, I not only accept my brainweirdness (the best I can, which does depend a fair share on the day), but I use it in a way that simulates my _own_&nbsp;community, even if that community is solely me. By having this concept of being brainweird, now it is no longer &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; but &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t understand each other.&rdquo; Equitable incommensurability, if you will. A two-way channel of _mis_communication. A way, although perhaps a bit Weird, to say &ldquo;it is okay if not everybody understands Exactly what I Mean.&rdquo;

And, now, due to increasingly threatening length of this document, I think that will conclude this posts example of what I have to say.

Here&rsquo;s hoping you Understand &#x1f609;
